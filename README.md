Clemont is a Python package for monitoring AI models for fairness and robustness. It provides multiple monitors and nearest-neighbor backends (BDD, FAISS, KDTree, and SNN) to detect violations of fairness and robustness constraints in real-time. 

### News

* August 3, 2025: Our paper "*Monitoring Robustness and Individual Fairness*" has been [awarded](https://kdd2025.kdd.org/awards/) Runner Up for the Best Paper Award in the research track of KDD '25!


## Quickstart

See `example.py` or `quant_example.py` for more detail.

```python
import numpy as np
from clemont.monitor import Monitor
from clemont.frnn import FaissFRNN, NaiveFRNN

# Generate random example data
datapoints = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
decisions = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000)

backend_factory = lambda: FaissFRNN(epsilon=0.2, metric="linf")
monitor = Monitor(backend_factory)

for index, (point, decision) in enumerate(zip(datapoints, decisions)):
    result = monitor.observe(point, decision, point_id=index)
    if result.counterexamples.ids: 
        raise RuntimeException("fairness violation!")
```


## Monitors

### $\epsilon$-monitor

Clemont observes a sequence of input-decision pairs $(x_1, y_1,), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ in an online fashion (or from a .csv file). The current pair is said to be a *violation* if there exists a past input-decision pair $x_j,y_j$ such that $d(x_j, x_n) < \epsilon$ and $y_j \neq y_n$, where $d$ is some distance metric on the input space, for example $L_\infty$. Clemont accepts input-decision pairs in its `.observe()` method and will return the index of any past pairs that form a violation with respect to the passed pair.

Clemont can maintain a throughput in the hundreds of samples per second even after processing tens of millions of samples, or at an input dimensionality in the tens of thousands, depending on the backend. See our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3711896.3737054) for detailed methodology and backend comparisons. **All experiments in the "*Monitoring Robustness and Individual Fairness*" paper were conducted with version 0.1.0.**


### Quantitative monitor

Given a stream of observations $p=(x,y)$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the input (features), and $y \in \Delta^{k-1}$ is the predicted *probability vector* (softmax), Clemont assigns a **continuous** score indicating how much the model’s output can change per unit of input change, relative to previously seen points. This is a local, data-driven analogue of a **Lipschitz constant**:

$$
\big((x,y),(x',y')\big) \;=\; \frac{d_{\text{out}}(y,y')}{d_{\text{in}}(x,x')}
$$

For a new point $p=(x,y)$ and a history $H$, the monitor reports

$$
Q(p;H) \;=\; \max_{(x',y')\in H} \frac{d_{\text{out}}(y,y')}{d_{\text{in}}(x,x')}.
$$

- **Large $Q$** ⇒ small input change caused a large output change (potential unfairness/instability).
- **Small $Q$** ⇒ outputs vary mildly relative to inputs (more stable).

This complements the ε-flip monitor (which answers “does there exist a nearby point with a different decision?”) with a **graded** notion (“how steep is the local slope?”).


## Installation

### Docker

For easy experimentation with all backends including BDD, use the provided Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image (may take a few minutes)
docker build -t clemont .
# Run the example script
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace clemont python example.py
# Run an interactive terminal for development
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace clemont
```

### pip

```bash
pip install clemont
```

#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Manual installation of BDD dependency (pip only)

The BDD backend requires the `dd.cudd` package, which cannot be automatically installed via pip due to its dependency on CUDD. As a result, if you plan to use the BDD backend, you must install `dd.cudd` manually by running the [official installation script](https://github.com/tulip-control/dd/blob/main/examples/install_dd_cudd.sh) in your Python environment (note that this is done automatically in the Docker image):

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tulip-control/dd/refs/heads/main/examples/install_dd_cudd.sh
chmod +x install_dd_cudd.sh
./install_dd_cudd.sh
```


## Notes

### SNN installation issues

SNN v0.0.6 should be installed automatically, and should work without issues, but note that more recent versions may be difficult to install due to packaging issues. A simple `pip install snnpy` may error out with a message about `pybind11`. If so, run:

```bash
pip install wheel setuptools pip --upgrade
pip install snnpy==0.0.6
```

On Apple Silicon, `brew install llvm libomp` may further be necessary (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60005176/how-to-deal-with-clang-error-unsupported-option-fopenmp-on-travis)) if the installation now fails for reasons related to OpenMP. If so, execute the above command and set the CC and CXX environment variables accordingly:

```
brew install llvm libomp
export CC=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang
export CCX=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++
```

The Dockerfile uses the most recent version of SNN and may be consulted for the installation procedure.

### Deprecated API

Files `runner.py` and `backends/*` implement the previous Clemont API and are deprecated.
